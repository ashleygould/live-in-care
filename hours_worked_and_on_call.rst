  Hours worked means the time during which an employee is
  subject to the control of an employer, and includes all the time
  the employee is suffered or permitted to work, whether or not
  required to do so.

Household Occupations 
  Household Occupations means all services related to the care of
  persons or maintenance of a private household or itspremises by
  an employee of a private householder. Said occupations shall

  (A) A LIVE-IN employee shall have at least 12 consecutive
      hours free of duty during each workday of 24 hours, and the
      total span of hours for a day of work shall be no more than 12
      hours, except under the following conditions:
  
  (1) The employee shall have at least three (3) hours free of

      in excess of nine (9) hours on the sixth (6th) and seventh (7th)
      workdays shall be compensated at double the employee's regular
      rate of pay.
  


My Interpretation
-----------------

With respect to live-in caregivers, Wage Order 15 requires:

- The worker must be paid at least minimum wage.  Oakland's
  Minimum Wage rate is $14.14 per hour.

- The worker gets 3 hours off in a 12-hour span of work.
  A nine hour work day.

- The worker gets 12 consecutive hours off in a 24-hour workday.
  Any work over 9 hours per day is overtime.

- The worker must have 24 consecutive hours off for every 5 days
  worked - except in an emergency.  Emergency work is paid
  overtime.

- If the worker works more than 5 days in a work week, they get
  paid overtime on the sixth and seventh days, and double time
  for work in excess of 9 hours on those days.






On-call hours
=============

Are hours spent sleeping when on-call to be considerd part of 
hours worked?

This is not specified in either EDD or IWC docs.  But I found
references to the 2015 CA Supreme Court ruling on Mendiola vs.
CPS Security, which ruled that employees (security guards)
required to sleep on work site as part of on-call duty should be
paid for time sleeping.  This case was specific to employees
covered by IWC Wage Order 4 

https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S212704.PDF

This decision was partly based on the degree of control the
employer has on the employee during on-call duty hours:

  (1)whether there was an on-premises living requirement;  
  
  (2) whether there were excessive geographical restrictions on
  employee‟s movements;  
  
  (3) whether the frequency of calls was unduly restrictive;  
  
  (4)whether a fixed time limit for response was unduly
  restrictive;  
  
  (5) whether the on-call employee could easily trade on-call
  responsibilities;  
  
  (6) whether use of a pager could ease restrictions; and  
  
  (7)whether theemployee had actually engaged in personal
  activities during call-in time.  

  Courts have also taken into account whether the on-call
  waiting time is spent primarily for the benefit of the
  employer and its business.


Does this case apply to WageOrder 15 employees?  Within the
conclusion the decision states:

  Accordingly, we conclude that the wage order does not permit
  the exclusion of sleep time from compensable hours worked in
  24-hour shifts covered by Wage Order 4.  We express no opinion as
  what may be required in other circumstances regulated by other
  wage orders.



Interpretation of Mendiola vs. CPS Security
-------------------------------------------

This post below sumerizes the situation and concludes live-in
care-givers should be paid for time sleeping.

from https://123homecares.com/sb-1344-reconsideration-of-live-in-mendiola-vs-cps-security-solutions-inc/

  On January 12, 2015, the California Supreme Court rendered the
  long-standing and heavily relied upon concept in the home care
  industry of 24 Hour “Live-in” Care unlawful, in its landmark
  decision in the case of Mendiola vs. CPS Security Solutions,
  Inc. (i.e. “the Mendiola decision”). Prior to the Mendiola
  decision, 8 hours of sleep/rest periods could be deducted from a
  caregiver’s wages, when that caregiver was providing home care
  in a successive 24 hour period of time (i.e. 24 hour “live-in”
  shifts = the cost of 16 hours of care).  The Mendiola decision
  nullified the use of the Federal Sleep Time Deduction for
  employees that fall under California Wage Order 4 because the
  language of that wage order did not specifically cite the
  Federal Sleep Time Provision.  Consequently, this ruling created
  significant uncertainty for home care agencies with employees
  that fall under Wage Order 15, which also does not specifically
  cite the Federal Sleep Time Deduction. Accordingly,
  post-Mendiola decision, “Live-in” caregivers must now be paid
  for ALL (24 hours) hours present in the home (including
  applicable overtime). This has resulted in doubling the cost of
  care for “Live-In” cases for seniors and other frail
  Californians.


However, this next post suggests a work-around - if live-in
care-giver is not 'on-call' during off hours, then perhaps
Mendiola decision does not apply:

from https://www.griegolaw.com/contact-us/blog/2015/01/california-supreme-court-refuses-sleep-time-exemption/

  California requires employers to pay employees for all “hours
  worked.”  Most wage orders define hours worked at any time the
  employee is subject to the employer’s control and includes any
  time the employee is suffered or permitted to work.  This means
  that if the employer requires the employee to be in a specific
  place, the employee is under the employee’s control and must be
  compensated for that time.  There are some exceptions, such as
  wage order 5 which has a special definition of “hours worked”
  for employees that are required to live on the premises.
    
  There may be other alternatives to 24-hour care that families
  and care agencies should explore, and some employees may still
  qualify under a different definition of “hours worked.”  For
  example, if the employer does not require the employee to remain
  on the premises, then the employee is not necessarily working
  just because the employee chooses to remain on the premises
  after his/her shift ends.



In 2016 SB 1344 was put forwared.  This bill attempts to create
a homecare worker exemption similar to that in IWC WorkOrders 5
and 9, but it did not get out of committee.

My Interpretation
-----------------

Adhearing to the requirements set out in the Mendiola Decision
would cost over $145,000.00 per year, even at minumum wage:

+--------------------------------+
| 9 hrs @ $14.14 | $127.26       |
|15 hrs @ $28.28 | $424.20       |
+--------------------------------+
|daily wage      | $551.46       |
+--------------------------------+
|monthly wage	 | $12,132.12    |
+--------------------------------+
|annual wage	 | $145,585.44   |
+--------------------------------+

But ignoring Mendiola could leave us open to litigation.  If a
worker were able to prove they were required to be available for
24-hours per shift as on-call, they could potentially be awarded for
backpay for 15 hours per day over-time plus interest plus legal
fees.

I recommend we hire our household worker for a normal 9 out of
12 hours shift 5 days a week and stipulate there is no on-call
requirment.  The 12 consecutive off-duty hours is truly
off-duty.  We must have a written plan for meeting any emergency
events that occur during the worker's off-duty hours without
involving the worker in any way.
